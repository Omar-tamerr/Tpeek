## 🌟 What is Tpeek?

**Tpeek** is a professional-grade, Python-powered network scanning tool built on top of Nmap.  
It is designed for penetration testers, red teamers, and network admins to quickly identify open ports, detect OS types, and enumerate common services — all with real-time terminal feedback and clean output.
